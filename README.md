The notebooks shared here include code and results from analyses outlined in the manuscript "Karalunas et al. Continuous dimensions, not latent groups, best capture cognitive and neural developmental variation in childhood."

- The .html files capture the k-means based analyses reported in the manuscrupt. These files need to be downloaded and opened in a browser to view the code and the plots. The code is written in Julia language. The version of Julia and the relevant packages are listed at the end of each .html page. 
- The .m file captures the community detection approach used in the paper. It depends on two packages: BCT (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) and matlab-networks-toolbox (https://github.com/ivanbrugere/matlab-networks-toolbox/tree/master).
